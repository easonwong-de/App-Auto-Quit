This is just an app idea. I personally use [Swift Quit](https://github.com/onebadidea/swiftquit).

# App Auto Quit

Terminates macOS app when all of its windows are closed.

Currently, the script only works with Preview, Notes, Calendar, and TextEdit.

## Known Issue

The file selection dialog does not count as the appâ€™s window, thus the app will be terminated if the file selection dialog is its only active window.
